## ✨ Basics of Java  

Start your journey with the **fundamentals** of Java:  
- 🔢 **Data Types**: int, float, char, String, boolean, etc.  
- 🔄 **Control Structures**: `if-else`, `switch`, `for`, `while`, and `do-while` loops.  
- 🛠️ **Methods**: Defining, calling, and using method overloading.  
- 🔗 **Arrays**: Single-dimensional and multi-dimensional arrays.  
- 📦 **Packages**: Understanding and creating packages.  
- 📚 **Exception Handling**: Try-catch blocks, `finally`, and custom exceptions.

## 🏛️ Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)  

Master the core concepts of **Object-Oriented Programming** in Java:  
- 🧱 **Classes and Objects**: Defining classes, creating objects, and accessing methods and fields.  
- 🧰 **Encapsulation**: Using private fields and public getters/setters.  
- 🔄 **Inheritance**: Single and multilevel inheritance, `super` keyword.  
- 🧩 **Polymorphism**: Method overloading and overriding.  
- 🏗️ **Abstraction**: Abstract classes and interfaces.  
- 🔐 **Access Modifiers**: `public`, `private`, `protected`, and default.

## 📄 Writing Data to Excel Files  

Learn how to interact with **Excel files** using Java libraries like **Apache POI**:  
- 📄 **Creating Excel Files**: Write data into `.xlsx` files.  
- 🗂️ **Adding Sheets**: Work with multiple sheets in an Excel workbook.  
- 🖋️ **Writing Data**: Add rows, columns, and cell values.  
- 🎨 **Formatting**: Apply styles like bold, font size, and colors to cells.  

💡 **Note**: Make sure to include the Apache POI dependency in your project.

## 🎨 GUI Development Using Swing  

Build stunning **Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs)** with **Swing**:  
- 🪟 **Creating Windows**: Use `JFrame` to create application windows.  
- 🎛️ **Adding Components**: Work with `JButton`, `JLabel`, `JTextField`, and other widgets.  
- 🔗 **Event Handling**: Handle button clicks and other user interactions.  
- 🧩 **Layouts**: Organize components using layout managers (`FlowLayout`, `GridLayout`, `BorderLayout`).  
- ✨ **Build a Calculator**: Create a simple calculator application to perform basic arithmetic operations.
